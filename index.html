        <h1>Happy Valentine's Day!</h1>
        <p class="message">Hi baby, this one is for you. HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY!! I know stuff has been hard in the past few weeks, but I want you to know that I really really love you and you're the most most most awesome person on this earth. You get me like no one else does, I love how both of us have the same love language, and I ABS LOVED the Kinder Joy toys and the flowers you used to get me. I love hugging you, I love kissing you, and I LOVE YOUR DRAMA. I loveee our calls, hangouts, makeouts, and our dates. I love spending time with you, even if it means being on call and saying absolutely nothing. You're my baby, sweetheart, love, but more than anything else, you're my best friend. 

I want to apologize for all the mistakes I've made in the past, and I promise to work on myself so that I don't overflow it onto you. Yesterday, after reading chats of you and Kiya, I realized how hard it must be for you to be with me right now. I also realized that I should not be expecting anything from you at the moment. I know taking it slow is not our specialty, but this time, we will. 

I believe in us, Avik. I believe in our pinky promise. And even though you don't, I'm fine with that because I know the day you actually do believe in it, it‚Äôs going to be 100%. I love you, Avik, I really do. You're my monkey (yk the full form)üíï </p>
